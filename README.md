# engineering-schools-ast-prep-guide

As an AST student (Accès Sous Titre DEUG – MIP Informatique, mention Bien), I applied to several top engineering schools in Morocco.  
After months of focused preparation, I successfully gained admission to some of them.  
This repository shares the exact resources, roadmaps, and study strategies I used, to help other AST students achieve the same goal.
